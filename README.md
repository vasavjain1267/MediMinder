‚è∞Comprehensive Meds Reminder
We designed a medicine reminder app that fulfils all your medication needs in one place: pill reminders (e.g. for birth control pills), a comprehensive database of OTC and Rx medications, support for any dosage form (incl. tablet, pill, inhalation, injection) frequency, and even refill reminders. And as the app is not only a pill alarm but also a medication tracker, you just need to check its pill diary to make sure you‚Äôve taken that important dose.
